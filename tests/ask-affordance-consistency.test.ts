/**
 * Guards the "ask about this" / "read case study" affordances.
 *
 * History worth keeping, because each rule here comes from a real bug:
 *  - Four separate components once did this one job, each styled differently.
 *  - Three surfaces had no affordance at all while every existing one looked
 *    consistent, so a consistency check alone passed.
 *  - Rendering the pill inline inside a data-driven heading moved it to a
 *    different spot on every card.
 *  - The affordances were hover-revealed; they are now always visible, and the
 *    tests below assert that directly so hiding cannot quietly return.
