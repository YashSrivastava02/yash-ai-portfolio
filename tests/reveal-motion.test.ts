/**
 * Scroll reveals must not fade opacity.
 *
 * Backdrop blur only reads as glass once the element is opaque enough to have a
 * visible fill, so animating a glass panel up from `opacity: 0` left it looking
 * flat for the whole reveal and then snapping to glass. At 0.6s duration plus
 * up to 0.4s of stagger, that was a full second of every glass surface on the
 * page rendering wrong after load — measured as 18 glass-wrapping elements
 * shipped at `opacity: 0` in the production HTML.
 *
 * The slide is what carries the entrance; the fade was the part that broke.
